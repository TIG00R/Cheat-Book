### Network:

- Ensure that the app is using secure connections (TLS).
- All platforms have some trusted CAs in their trust store, Apple has 200+. but the apps should restrict the trust even more to their own servers only through **Identity Pinning** which includes: (**Certificate Pinning** or **Public Key Pinning**). you can refer to [OWASP Certificate Pinning cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Pinning_Cheat_Sheet.html)

#### Verifying TLS settings for the server.
- **Verify using the right protocols**:  **TLS v1.0** and **v1.1** are deprecated by most browsers since 2020. so, its recommended to not support them.
- **Verify using the right cipher suits**:
    - cipher suits terminology `Protocol_KeyExchangeAlgorithm_WITH_BlockCipher_IntegrityCheckAlgorithm`, ex `TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA`
        - **TLS**: Protocol
        - **RSA**: Key exchange algorithms
        - **3DES_EDE_CBC**: Block cipher
        - **SHA**: Integrity check algorithm
    - testing cipher suits:
        - `nscurl` on macOS
        - `testssl.sh`
#### Intercepting Traffic
##### HTTP & HTTPS Traffic
For HTTPs traffic we can:
- Add burp certificate to the user trust store on the phone. then we'll be able to intercept the traffic
- If there was pinning (certificate / public key) pinning, we'll have to do SSL Unpinning
##### Non-HTTP Traffic
We can intercept non-http traffic (TCP / UDP) using:
- [Nope-Proxy](https://testssl.sh)
- [Mitm Relay](https://github.com/jrmdev/mitm_relay)
##### Intercepting traffic from the app process
If the app implements a custom Network stack (Not using normal APIs). 
https://hackmag.com/security/ssl-sniffing/
##### Intercepting traffic on the network layer
- Should be used when non proxy-aware frameworks are used (ex: **Xamarin**). or if the application just ignores it. Also when another protocol other than HTTP is being used (ex: **XMPP**), 
- There are 3 ways to intercept **Xamarin** app traffic:

    1. Add a proxy to the app in the `onCreate` or `Main()` method and recreate the app
    ```java copy filename="Java"
    WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy = new WebProxy("192.168.11.1", 8080);
    ```
    2. Add the burp proxy ip to `/etc/hosts` asif it was the application server. and:
        - Redirect traffic from port `443` to burp port.
        - Redirect the traffic out of burp to the actual server and port. 
    we can use `iptables` for that
    ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
    sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:8080
    ```
    3. MITM attack using **Bettercap**
- We can use **Wireshark** for monitoring traffic, also we can use **Bettercap** to perform a MITM if needed.
- On a rooted or jailbroken device, we can setup a proxy using code injection tools (ex: [inspeckage](https://github.com/ac-pm/Inspeckage)) or full instrumentation frameworks like **Frida** and **Cycript**
- On ios, we can use **RemoteVirtuaInterface**
Note that starting with Android 7.0. (API level 24) the OS no longer trusts a user supplied CA certificate unless specified in the app.

**Note**:
- Starting with Android 7.0. (API level 24) the OS no longer trusts a user supplied CA certificate unless specified in the app.
- For IOS you can just install the user certificate and you'll be able to intercept the HTTPs traffic

### Cryptography
- Identify Insecure and/or Deprecated Cryptographic Algorithms such as:
    - DES
    - 3DES
    - RC2
    - RC4
    - BLOWFISH
    - MD4
    - MD5
    - SHA1
- Identify cryptographic misconfigurations such as:
    - Insufficient key length
    - Symetric encryption with hardcoded keys
- Look at [MASTG](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/0x04g-Testing-Cryptography/#protecting-keys-in-storage-and-in-memory) for more cryptography misconfigurations
### Code Quality
#### Injection Attacks
##### SQL Injection
##### XML Injection
- **XXE**:
By using the following payload, we can cause a DOS on the application because the `/dev/random` will retrieve endless stream of bytes 
    ```xml copy filename="XML"
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <!DOCTYPE foo [
    <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///dev/random" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo>
    ```
    <Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘»">
    Mobile apps can use XML not just for communicating with servers. XML payloads can also be parsed by local parsers like `NSXMLParser` on IOS 
    </Callout>
##### **XSS**
- In the context of native apps, XSS risks are far less prevalent for the simple reason these kinds of applications do not rely
on a web browser. However, apps using WebView components, such as **WKWebView** or the deprecated **UIWebView** on iOS
and WebView on Android, are potentially vulnerable to such attacks.
- If a WebView is used to display a remote website, the burden of escaping HTML shifts to the server side. If an XSS flaw
exists on the web server, this can be used to execute script in the context of the WebView. As such, it is important to
perform static analysis of the web application source code.
- for more info [MASTG](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/0x04h-Testing-Code-Quality/#cross-site-scripting-flaws)
- Examples of a vulnerable WebView 
    - Java
     ```java copy filename="Java"
     webView.loadUrl("javascript:initialize(" + myNumber + ");");
     ```
    - Kotlin
    ```kotlin copy filename="Kotlin"
    webView.loadUrl("javascript:initialize($myNumber);")
    ```
##### **Vulnerable Libraries**
    - When working with x509 formatted certificate data, ensure that secure parsers are used. For instance **Bouncy Castle below version 1.6 allows for Remote Code Execution by means of unsafe reflection**
