### Accessing the Device Shell

**Android**
- `adb`
    ```shell filename="Terminal" copy
    adb shell
    adb root # if working on emulator. next adb connect will be a root shell directly
    adb -s emulator-5554 shell # -s for multiple devices
    ```

- `SSH` using [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&pli=1)  
    - Can be used as an SSH server
    - Can also be used as an on-device shell app
    
**iOS**
- Using `SSH`
    - The IOS device must be jailbroken in order to install `OpenSSH` on it 
    - Using **Cydia** or **Sileo** we can to install `OpenSSH`
    - We can change the defualt password `alpine` by editing it in the `/private/etc/master.password` file
 
- `SSH` over TCP <br /> 
Using [Usbmuxd](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/usbmuxd) which is a socket USB multiplixing daemon. it listens for new USB connections to iOS devices and maps these connections to localhost TCP ports
```shell filename="Terminal" copy
# usbtmuxd handles the connection multiplexing over the USB
# iproxy leverages the usbmuxd multiplixing to create a tunnel between port 2222 on localhost to port 22 on mobile  
brew install libimobiledevice
iproxy 2222 22 
ssh -p 2222 root@localhost
```
- On device shell (shell emulator) using [NewTerm2](https://chariz.com/get/newterm)

### Host-Device data transfer

**Android**
- `adb`
    ```bash filename="Terminal" copy
    adb push # upload
    adb pull # download
    ```
- `objection -g com.package.name explore` <br />
Note: will only have access to the file that the app has access to
    ```bash filename=Terminal" copy
    ls # list files
    file download # download files from device to hosts
    file upload # upload files from host to device
    ```

**iOS**

- `scp`
    ```bash filename="Terminal" copy
    scp -P 2222 root@localhost:/file/path . # copy file from device to host current directory
    ```
- `objection`
    ```bash filename="Terminal" copy
    # objection will inside the app bundle directory /var/containers/Bundle/Applications
    file download 
    file upload
    env # view the directories of the app
    ```

### Obtaining apps

**Android**
- [APKMirror](https://apkmirror.com/)
- [APKPure](https://apkmirror.com/)
- [gplaycli](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tools/android/MASTG-TOOL-0016/)
    ```bash filename="Terminal" copy
    gplaycli -p -v -d com.google.android.keep
    ```
- Extracting from the device:
    - `adb`
        ```bash filename="Terminal" copy
        adb path package_name # Get the path to the base.apk of the file
        # then download it with adb pull
        ```
    - [APKExtractor](https://github.com/Domilopment/apk-extractor)

**iOS**
#### Downloading the ipa
- `itms-services` which is an OTA (over-the-air) download way used for distributing the ipa files for testers
  ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
  # itms-services -u "itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/test-uat/manifest.plist" -o - > out.ipa
  ```
#### Restoring ipa from the device
- the .ipa when installed. it gets decompressed into a directory inside `/var/containers/Bundle/Applications/UUID/` and this directory`app_name.app` directory
- This is the actual structure inside the `.ipa` file
  ```bash copy filename=".ipa"
  MyApp.ipa
  └── Payload
    └── MyApp.app
        ├── MyApp
        ├── Info.plist
        ├── (other app resources)
  ```
- in order to restore the ctual `ipa` file. we can we can download the `MyApp.app` directory. put it inside a directory and name it `Payload` and zip this directory and rename it to `MyApp.ipa` and that's how we can get the actual `ipa` file that had been installed
- notice that this ipa will be encrypted. (all ipa files are encrypted during transmission and rest on the device disk. they only get decrypted when being run) 
  ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
  zip -r MyApp.ipa Payload
  ```
#### Extracting the app binary 
- The app binary is the **MachO** binary file within the ipa package. and is usualy encrypted.
- Can be found in `/var/containers/Bundle/Applications/UUID/Application_Name.App/ApplicationName`
#### Decryting the app binary
  - we can check if the ipa is encrypted or not using:
    - `otool`
      ```bash copy filename="Terminal" showLineNumbers {7}
      otool Twitter.App/Twitter # where Twitter is the MachO binary of the Twitter app
      Load command 13
            cmd LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO_64
      cmdsize 24
      cryptoff 16384
      cryptsize 8962048
      cryptid 1 # Notice cryptid=1 means this binary is encrypted 
      ```
    - `radar2`
      ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
      rabin2 -I Application.App/Application | grep -i crypto
      # crypto can be a false or true . indicating the binary file is encrypted ot not
      ```
  - we can decrypt it using [frida-ios-dump](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump)
#### Thinning the app binary
 **Fat Binary**
	- Is a file type that contains extra information to run on multiple architectures `arm_v7` (32) and `arm64` as example
	- If you `file` or `lipo`  commands on this file. it will show you that its a binary with 2 architectures.
		```bash copy filename="Terminal"
		lipo -archs binary_name
		```
	- you can extract each of them separately (**Thinning the app**)
		```bash copy filename="Terminal"
		lipo -extract armv7 fat_binary_file -output binary_armv7
		```
### Patching Apps 
Patching an app refers to injecting the frida-gadget.so into the app. and repackaging and resigning it again. in order to be able to test the app on a non-rooted or non-jailbroken device

**Android**
- `objection`
```bash copy filename="Terminal"
objection patchapk --source app.apk 
```

**iOS**
- `objection`
```bash copy fileaname="Terminal"
objection patchipa --source my-app.ipa --codesign-signature 0C2E8200Dxxxx
```
the ipa then must be sideloaded into the ios device
### Installing Apps

**Android**
- `adb`
```bash terminal fileanme="Terminal"
adb install app.apk
```

**iOS**
- Trollstore
- Sideloadly
- AltServer

  unzip Name.ipa
  ios-deploy --bundle 'Payload/Name.app' -W -d -v
  ```
### Listing installed apps
**Android**

- `adb`
  ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
  adb shell pm list packages -3 -f
  # -3 for listing only 3rd party apps
  # -f for showing the app file path

  adb shell pm path com.app.name # show app path on the device 
  ```

### SSL Pinning Bypasse
- frida
- objection
- XPosed Framework: Install the [TrustMeAlready](https://github.com/ViRb3/TrustMeAlready) ↗ or [SSLUnpinning](https://github.com/ac-pm/SSLUnpinning_Xposed) ↗ module. have a look at [Using TrustMeAlready and SSLUnpinning2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8qWrLXHdV0)
#### Bypass custom certificate pinning
There are 3 ways for custom certificate pinning:
- **Certificate Hashes**
  ```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  # search for the cert hashes to replace with burp cert hashes
  grep -ri "sha256\|sha1" ./smali
  ```
- **Certificate Files** <br /> 
  ```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  # Search for certificate files to replace with our burp cert
  find ./assets -type f \( -iname \*.cer -o -iname \*.crt \  
  ```
- **TrustStore files**
  ```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  # search for the truststores to add burp cert to them
  find ./ -type f \( -iname \*.jks -o -iname \*.bks \
  ```

### Decompilation and Disassembly
#### Android
##### Decompiling Java Code
- jadx
- jadx-gui 
- apktool
- apkx
- apklab

##### Disassembling Native code
- **JNI** (Java native interface): defines a way for java code to interact with native code written in c/c++ which are compiled in the form of `.so` files and get loaded during runtime with `System.load` method
- [JavaJNI.APK challenge](./CTF/helloworldjni)

#### iOS
- Swift and ObjectiveC apps in iOS are both compiled to ARM assembly.
- We should [objtain the decrypted **MachO** file first from the ipa file](#extracting-the-app-binary)  
##### Disassembling Native Code
- analyze the binary using IDAPro, Ghidra, ... etc
##### Decompiling Native Code
- Only Hopper is konwn that can do that 
### Retrieving Strings
#### Android
##### From Dex
- Ghidra --> Window -> Definded Strings
- Dextra
  ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
  Dextra -S classes.dex
  ```
- Hopper
##### From Native binaries
- Ghidra
- iaito (gui for radar2)
- [Cutter](https://cutter.re) the official Rizin GUI
- radar2
  ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
  rabin2 -zz file
  ```
- strings
- Hopper
