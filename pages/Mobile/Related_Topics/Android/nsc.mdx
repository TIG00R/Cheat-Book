- **NSC** or **Network Security Configuration** is a feature for android applications that allows the apps to control their network communications.
- It allows the apps to:
    - Enable or Disable the usage of clear text traffic
    - SSL Pinning
    - Specify **Custom trust anchors**: Customize which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are trusted for an app's secure connections.
  - the path to `network_security_config` file can be spotted within AndroidManifest.xml file by looking for `android:network_Security_Config`
    ```xml filename="AndroidManifest.xml"
    <application android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"
    ```
  - Within the network_security_config file, the trusted anchors can be specified using 3 flags as follows
    ```xml
      <certificates 
        src=["system" | "user" | "raw resource"]
        overridePins=["true" | "false"] 
      />
    ```
    - Each certificate can be one of the following:
      - `raw resource` is an ID pointing to a file containing X.509 certificates
      - `system` for the pre-installed system CA certificates
      - `user` for user-added CA certificates
  - So, in order to force the app to trust our installed certificate, we can 
    - patch its `network_security_config` file and make it trust the `user` certificates as the following example
      ```xml copy filename="network_security_config"
      <network-security-config>
      <base-config>
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="system" />
            <certificates src="user" />
        </trust-anchors>
      </base-config>
      </network-security-config>
      ```
      this can be done manually or by using [Android-CertKiller](https://github.com/51j0/Android-CertKiller)
    - Use Magisk module to always trust user certificates [MagiskTrustUserCerts](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/MagiskTrustUserCerts/releases)
      From now on, any CA certificate that is installed by the user via "Settings", "Security & location", "Encryption & credentials", "Install from storage" (location may differ) is automatically pushed into the system's trust store by this Magisk module. Reboot and verify that the CA certificate is listed in "Settings", "Security & location", "Encryption & credentials", "Trusted credentials" (location may differ).
- **NSC** can also be used for SSL Pinning [MASTG](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/0x05g-Testing-Network-Communication/#default-configurations)
