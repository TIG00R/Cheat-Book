### What is a group policy object? 

A GPO is a predefined command, script, or task execution template controlling any number of Windows OS systems and policies. GPOs come standard with — and are managed through — [Microsoft Active Directory](https://www.varonis.com/securing-active-directory/?hsLang=en). Through Active Directory, system administrators can apply GPOs to users, machines, or software throughout an entire organization.
